Unofficial F-Droid client that resembles the classic F-Droid client.

The client supports all basic F-Droid features, such as repository management and package installation. It doesn't support privileged extension, root installation, or local repositories.

Features:

* Classic F-Droid style, without cards or inappropriate animations
* Fast repositories synchronization under good network conditions
* Built upon standard Android components and a minimal set of dependencies
* Made with attention to details, both in program logic and design
